    <h1>debt-disobedience</h1>
    <p>This space is crafted for those who struggle with their debts and lose sleep at night or fall into anxious spirals. It especially embraces the feminized and racialized working-class folks, so we can –as Luci Cavallero and Veronica Gago have inspired us– take our debts out of the closet and fix our gaze on the historic and economic conditions that purposefully and unjustly had and continue to indebt households, women, LGBTQ+ youth, trans workers, single mothers, migrant families and many more.</p>
