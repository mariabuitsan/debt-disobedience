        <p id="explicacion"> Studies on Post-natal depression and motherhood show how financial hardships bear more weight than purely biological explanations. In a study on 2021 authors explained "The results beg more questions than they answer. They do not support a simple cause and effect relationship, yet they imply that debt is an important aspect of the link between financial adversity and depression. Rather than a linear pathway there may be a circular one; worries about debt contribute to making depression worse, while depression causes women to worry more about their debt and deal with them less effectively".</p>
